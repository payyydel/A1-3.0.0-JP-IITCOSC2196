                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    My project will be a website and accompanying app platforms. The 
                    purpose of this site will be to host a centralised voting hub and 
                    journalistic/forum-based news and reviews platform. Specifically surrounding 
                    streaming sites and primarily original content produced and released by them. 
                    Allowing audiences to have their honest say and virtually transforming the way 
                    streaming original shows and films are picked up by companies. The goal is to 
                    partner will all major and zone-specific streaming companies in an effort to provide 
                    them with a means by which to hear from audiences, rather than relying solely on 
                    initial viewing numbers.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    An ever-growing industry, with no signs of stopping “the streaming industry is expected to be worth $330 billion by 2030”. 
                    A number of platforms have entered the market from nearly all major motion picture studios and networks, and the COVID-19 
                    pandemic only built momentum in terms of subscriber growth. However, the likes of titans such as Netflix have lost north of 
                    1.1 million subscribers since the start of 2022. Reasons multiply the more you read about it, but one obvious and relatable 
                    factor is the “quality of content” on the platform. Netflix is a pioneer in the medium of online streaming platforms; 
                    capitalising on that, they began producing and releasing original content on their platforms globally, with notable fan 
                    favourites like Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why. But lately, they’ve been lacking in content consumers want to see, 
                    instead opting to cancel numerous shows after only 1 pilot season runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this commotion has called into question why all these shows and film franchises are being scrapped before they have a 
                    chance to truly soar. Unfortunately, controversy is corrosive, and people are stubborn. Questions like these are already being 
                    asked of platforms that are, by Netflix’s standards, effectively in their infancy. The likes of Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime 
                    Video, Paramount+, HBO Max and so forth are having their content placed under scrutiny, and their decisions even more so. 
                    With “change.org” petitions and Reddit-specific forums gaining more and more traffic with every cancellation, or controversial approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, this will present a particular challenge and opportunity for budding and tenured directors, writers, actors etc. 
                    that they can rise to. Short-form video has already been popularised through the likes of social media apps like TikTok and 
                    Instagram. Attempting to communicate and compel people in a single or limited series run format, will really allow creatives 
                    to put their best foot forward. The bar has been raised, and the masses have higher standards than ever before. As such, the 
                    need for a centralised space by which to discuss, review, view and vote is long overdue.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The sites and platforms will be designed to offer features and functionality that promote equal say and transparency 
                    across the board. With that in mind, it will include...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dedicated news feed, which will be comprised of not only reviews but articles surrounding relevant production/streaming 
                    platform updates, production controversies and information curated to keep audiences informed.
                </p>
                <ul id="pidescription-list">
                    <li>
                        The idea behind this section is to truly embody transparency by putting our best foot forward, so people can put theirs. 
                        The behaviour of large-scale corporations and companies, as well as profiting individuals, is equally as relevant as the quality 
                        of a film or show. Viewers should be given the opportunity to have an informed say. Entertainment for entertainment's sake isn’t enough. 
                        If circumstances are not above board. People need to be held accountable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The aim is to combat toxic work environments and executives while promoting ethical choices. In that spirit, all articles 
                        will be screened. We’re not in the business of invading personal lives where it doesn’t concern us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Features.

                <p>
                    Account customisation and setup. Provide us with as little, or as much information as you’re comfortable with. Common sense 
                    allowing. Bearing in mind, that when others read your reviews or reasonings, your credibility may be called into question.

                    <li>
                        Creating a fully autonomous website will require coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code editors such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Code Studio</a>, 
                        <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> 
                        etc. will also be necessary for supporting code development, updates, and maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A user-interface framework like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">“Twitter Bootstrap”</a> will be 
                        helpful in creating code variations as well as simplifying and speed-up front-end development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using data structure repositories through version control platforms such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> 
                        will be paramount in the initial construction and further maintaining the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Version control platforms like <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> also provide developers with a mountain of 
                        support, with intentional design features and functionality to promote seamless collaboration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Maintaining copies of all active and archived files will be a priority. Using the “3 2 1 Backup” method, usage 
                        of two on-site, independent read device formats will be employed. Including local drives, and external drives. 
                        And one online cloud-based solution such as <a href="https://www.idrive.com" target="_blank">“IDrive”</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.backblaze.com" target="_blank">“Backblaze”</a> or <a href="https://spideroak.com" target="_blank">“SpiderOak One”</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to backup solutions, file sharing services will also be required. The likes of 
                        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage" target="_blank">Microsoft One Drive</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> 
                        can be used. I aim to stay away from more personal cloud solutions like iCloud, simply because those types of platforms are designed around consumer 
                        needs and are, by extension, less than ideal surrounding support, flexibility, and security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphic design programs to assist in concept creation and design implementation will also be required. I’ve found the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe CC Suite</a> 
                        to be a great place to start, boasting a wealth of versatile and familiar programs.

                <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>
                    Experience in front-end coding languages, navigation and usage of different backup processes and cloud-based file sharing services, 
                    familiarity with version control platforms, design composition and execution with industry-standard programs, general resourcefulness 
                    and troubleshooting skills surrounding asset sourcing and code maintenance etc. and knowledge of prelaunch processes, statistics, and 
                    validations in order to launch and integrate new sections or platforms. Acquiring all these skills will be a career-building initiative, 
                    requiring dedication and development in new areas and skills. Undergraduate degrees will require 3 years minimum of study time, although 
                    all these processes can be self-taught.

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    If successful, this initiative will effectively change the way streaming companies can approach original content productions, saving 
                    themselves potentially millions, and bringing profit margins back up to scratch. Imagine being able to view pilot episodes, or limited 
                    series runs, which are in essence teasers for potential shows. Initial productions would be much shorter. While waiting for audiences 
                    and journalists alike to review and vote on content. Turnaround times will be a factor, but with more devoted resources, and a launch 
                    period, there will be plenty of content to boot in the meantime. Content people actually want to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, allowing everyday audiences to have their say, and shot, at being heard; whilst also keeping them informed on all the variables, 
                    in an effort to make to most responsible and ethically sound decisions. Entertainment that’s made for the people and chosen and informed 
                    by the people has the potential to open up a world of possibilities. Hopefully, one day melting the borders between what could’ve been, 
                    what shouldn’t be and what will be. Inspiring and empowering people to share honest opinions.
