                    I believe self-awareness is an asset. A tool to be delicately wielded. These results 
                    simply articulate my inner workings and allow me the resources to make informed and 
                    healthy decisions. I don’t believe these results will have a particularly noticeable 
                    effect in a group context. A bolstered ego isn’t really in line with my personality 
                    type, nor does it play a part in my personal demeanour. The only impact I believe 
                    these results may have is a reaffirming one. The results are accurate because I place 
                    great value on a team that fosters equal opportunity and free-flowing ideas. Clear 
                    and empathetic communication towards a person's particular point of view is a must. 
                    Furthermore, conflict isn’t a particularly strong suit of mine; however, I believe 
                    that honesty is the best policy in a professional environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When forming a team, I believe in honesty upfront but genuine encouragement that 
                    doesn't make people bloated or overfed. Honesty when explaining my capabilities, life 
                    circumstances that may inadvertently impact my team, and its work. The results form a 
                    coherent and easy-to-understand means to express this to a group.

                    The results are very actionable. Relatively speaking, definitively 
                    knowing more about my learning style allows for a more methodical 
                    approach. Or as methodical as I can manage. There's no point in trying 
                    to drastically change my learning style. Leaning into my strengths can 
                    only benefit my team and me. Obviously, I'd choose to share the results 
                    upfront. An informed team is a team ready to plan, and as lovely Ben 
                    summed it up, "if you fail to plan, you plan to fail". Considering how 
                    everyone else learns, dividing work reasonably, but playing to people's 
                    strengths. As well as collectively collaborating on tasks that push 
                    people's limits. I've found that remaining static and comfortable is a 
                    remarkably prolonged learning method and a surefire way to eventually 
                    regress.

                    These results are not driven by any emotional or personality-based bias but instead 
                    by factual reasoning designed to be more accurately reflective of one’s innate and 
                    developed abilities surrounding inductive and deductive reasoning. Partnered with 
                    more personality-based results, these allow me to determine more objectively what I'm 
                    capable of on a more factual level. I believe they would provide an insightful and 
                    logical perspective during decision and problem-solving situations. Combined with 
                    varying different perspectives and strengths, I’ll be able to thoughtfully contribute 
                    to team discussions and workloads. While inductive and deductive reasoning inherently 
                    helps make decisions based on factual evidence surrounding an individual's present 
                    abilities. While objectively sound, I mustn’t be remiss when considering less 
                    personality and emotion-based variables. Being respectful and seeing potential can be 
                    just as rewarding as being cold and calculating.
