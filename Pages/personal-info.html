                    <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m interested in learning to create and maintain. Currently, I’m most 
                        attracted to learning to code and eventually program. Varying different 
                        languages that directly impact and affect our lives, because my interest 
                        lies within technologies enabling potential. I believe that technology 
                        has the potential to serve the betterment of humanity. It’s helped us build 
                        cities, rockets and structures that sit on the moon. It’s allowed us to 
                        cultivate economies, and artists, giving dreamers a voice and a medium to 
                        express their ideas. Most recently, and recognisable is its capacity to 
                        keep us connected through the hardest, and most trying of times. Namely 
                        COVID-10. Now while a world connected and supported is breathtakingly 
                        beautiful; it’s also hauntingly dangerous. 
                    <p>
                        My interest in IT started in 
                        my adolescence. Like the majority of Gen Z, I had the privilege of growing 
                        up with a computer in my pockets, tenfold more powerful than the original 
                        Turing Machine used to decode Nazi transmissions or the IBM 7090s used by 
                        NASA during the Space Race in the 60s. And despite my other youthful 
                        passions, technology remained a constant, yet ever-changing variable, 
                        enabling me, and others like me. I wasn’t born with an iPad in my stroller, 
                        but I did drool over the opportunistic “Computer Classes” we had in Primary 
                        School in the late 2000s, and early 2010s. I have fond memories of using 
                        the classic bitmap drawer ‘KidPix’, or playing the very first builds, and 
                        on the pioneering servers of Minecraft. I started with the classic Nokia 
                        3310, playing snake. Couple that with an iPod Shuffle 2nd Gen, and I was 
                        good to go. Till that fateful day, when I got my first hand-me-down iPhone 
                        5 from my dad. I cherished that, and still have it tucked away to this day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technology and the role it plays in our everyday lives is so overt, it’s covert. 
                        On the surface, we use smartphones for everything, and our perception of the 
                        computer in our pockets is white-washed by all the social media, and streaming 
                        services we’re constantly plugged into. But rarely do we ever wonder what it 
                        takes to maintain and upkeep such an essential part of our lives. That’s why 
                        I’m interested in IT. All too often I found myself stopping and wondering how 
                        everything is interconnected. What it takes to make something as borderline 
                        comical as a smart-watch function. What prompted the introduction of first-person 
                        shooters into the gaming market? And where on God’s green Earth did it all come from?
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Narrowing down a particular event or person that sparked my interest in IT 
                        is hard. Growing up I had a general interest, built PCs, took IT electives, 
                        learn rudimentary forms of web development etc. However, if I were to narrow 
                        it down to something more recent, it would probably be a chain of events starting 
                        during the 2021 Sydney Lockdown. I applied and was successful in taking up a 
                        position in Apple’s retail stores. Initial in sales, I eventually moved to the 
                        Genius Bar as a technician. Pair that with Meta’s “Connect 2021” event and unveiling 
                        of their plans surrounding AR and VR technology. IT sprung to the forefront of 
                        my mind. AR especially has very promising commercial and well as industry-based 
                        applications. In an environment where people were isolated from each other, the 
                        pandemic showed that working from home was not only possible but, in some areas, 
                        beneficial. All ideas have rocky territory to navigate, but the concept of the 
                        “Metaverse”; a digital environment, utilising and implementing various forms of 
                        technology to aid in the crucial, social and collaborative “work-from-home” dilemma, 
                        is a promising step in the right direction. Companies like Meta aren’t the only 
                        ones pioneering ground-breaking concepts and technology. I don’t know where I’m 
                        going to fit into it, but I’m excited to see where this will take me.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Outline your IT experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        While remarkably limited, I do have experience in backend systems from a production 
                        standpoint. I’ve worked as an audio tech/engineer, a broadcast technician, a camera 
                        operator and most recently a Genius Bar technician (the equivalent of a mechanic to 
                        an engineer really). I’ve experienced the bare basics in coding languages such as 
                        JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I took IPT in high school as an elective in the 11th grade. 
                        All but useless if I’m being honest, and they didn’t pick it up as an elective going 
                        into the HSC. A mistake in my opinion.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Why did you choose RMIT?</h3>
                    <p>
                        With a rapidly changing, and dare I say, evolving means by to learn and enter the 
                        workforce/job, RMIT’s online study format, via Open Universities Australia, offers 
                        the flexibility and range I’m in the market for. Balancing working, studying and a 
                        healthy home/social life is no mean feat. Upon doing research, and speaking with 
                        student support advisors, friends and colleagues who have undergone, or are continuing 
                        to undergo online study, RMIT seemed like the logical choice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My larger degree, at this point in time, is the Bachelor of Information Technology, 
                        however, I do have a growing interest in coding, and programming. I’m fascinated by the 
                        prospect of backend development, and generally the skill it takes to build and maintain 
                        such large-scale systems.
