                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello,
                        I'm Joshua or Josh. I don't really have a preference. I am Filipino/Australian 
                        and grew up on the Northern Beaches of Sydney. I'm the eldest of 3 to 2 cheeky 
                        parents, and I have two gorgeous dogs. “Buddy", a 9-year-old Purebred Cattle Dog, 
                        and “Skatter”, a 2-and-a-half-year-old Pomeranian cross Maltese.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I work "around" the tech-based industry, less so "in it". I've always had a very 
                        active interest in coding, and I am in love with the progression of technology and 
                        its potential for humanity. Despite all the negative variables, I prefer to focus 
                        on the sheer innovation and imagination opportunities it can provide. Technology 
                        for the betterment of humankind, as it were. As for goals surrounding my studies. 
                        I'm interested in the field of Cyber Security or some variance of development, but 
                        I haven't quite narrowed that down yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside the course criteria, my personal interests include films, music, comics, 
                        and video games. Specifically, I really enjoy watching and dissecting all manner 
                        of films. Some of my all-time favourite directors are Wes Anderson, Edgar Wright, 
                        Zac Snyder, Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino. Most of the movies I love 
                        are remarkably stylised and are true testaments to what can be achieved when you 
                        look at it from a different perspective. I'm also a musician; I primarily play the 
                        guitar, but once upon a time, I played the piano and bass and sang, all at a 
                        relatively high proficiency. Nowadays, I casually grace the shower and my dogs 
                        with the sound of my voice and guitar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love varying comic and graphic novel types; however, my favourite "genre", as 
                        it is, is superheroes. I grew up reading about and watching them. Like any hectic 
                        fan, I have firm opinions on different topics and characters; yes, saying something 
                        "controversial" will trigger a tick in my brain. I may feel compelled to argue 
                        either for or against it. Finally, I play video games quite often. It’s a part of my 
                        weekly routine. Nowadays, I use it to destress, although, at times, it tends to have 
                        the opposite effect. But I have played my fair share of vintage to popular to obscure 
                        single-player/co-op campaign and multiplayers of varying genres, including sandboxes, 
                        multiplayer online battle arenas (M.O.A.B.), real-time strategies (R.T.S.), 
                        role-playing games (RPG), simulators, action-adventure and finally first and third 
                        person shooters, all whilst growing up. I loved most of them. Like so many other 
                        things, they represent different stages in my life, and I'm fond of nearly all of 
                        them for one reason or another. Except for "Battlefield 2042".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's worth mentioning that I am wildly introverted and prefer the company of the few 
                        over the many. I've struggled with social anxiety my entire life, but more recently, 
                        I've begun to take hold. I do socialise regularly, as required by my job. It's 
                        usually the way. I work as a Genius Bar technician at the Apple Store in Sydney. As 
                        you can imagine, empathy and kindness are essential when supporting people needing 
                        help.

                <h3>What is your interest in I.T.? When did your interest in I.T. start?</h3>
                <p>
                    My interest lies within technologies enabling potential. I'm curious about learning 
                    to create and maintain. Currently, I'm most attracted to learning to code and 
                    eventually program in varying different languages that directly impact and affect 
                    our lives. I believe that technology has the potential to serve the betterment of 
                    humanity. It's helped us build cities, rockets and structures that sit on the moon. 
                    It's allowed us to cultivate economies, and artists, giving dreamers a voice and a 
                    medium to express their ideas. Most recent and recognisably is its capacity to keep 
                    us connected through the most challenging and trying times. Namely COVID-19. Now 
                    while a world connected and supported is breathtakingly beautiful, it's also 
                    hauntingly dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in I.T. started in my adolescence. Like the majority of Gen Z, I had the 
                    privilege of growing up with a computer in my pockets, tenfold more potent than the 
                    original Turing Machine used to decode Nazi transmissions or the I.B.M. 7090s used by 
                    NASA during the Space Race in the 60s. And despite my other youthful passions, 
                    technology remained a constant yet ever-changing variable, enabling me and others 
                    like me. I wasn't born with an iPad in my stroller, but I did drool over the 
                    opportunistic "Computer Classes" we had in Primary School in the late 2000s and 
                    early 2010s. I have fond memories of using the classic bitmap drawer 'KidPix' 
                    and playing the very first builds on the pioneering servers, no less, of Minecraft. 
                    I started with the classic Nokia 3310, playing snake. Couple that with an iPod Shuffle 
                    2nd Gen, and I was good to go. Until that fateful day, I got my first hand-me-down 
                    iPhone 5 from my dad. I cherished that and still have it tucked away to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology and its role in our everyday lives is "so overt, it's covert". On the 
                    surface, we use smartphones for everything. Our perception of the computer in our 
                    pockets is whitewashed by the copious amounts of social media and streaming services 
                    we're constantly plugged into. But rarely do we wonder what it takes to maintain and 
                    upkeep such an essential part of our lives. That’s why I'm interested in I.T. All too 
                    often, I found myself stopping and wondering how everything is interconnected. What it 
                    takes to make something as borderline comical as a smart-watch function. What prompted 
                    the introduction of first-person shooters into the gaming market? And where on God’s 
                    green Earth did it all come from?
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
                <p>
                    Narrowing down a particular event or person who sparked my interest in I.T. isn't 
                    particularly easy. Growing up, I had a general interest, built P.C.s, took I.T. 
                    electives, learned rudimentary forms of web development etc. However, if I were to 
                    narrow it down to something more recent, it would probably be a chain of events 
                    starting during the 2021 Sydney Lockdown. I applied and successfully took up a position 
                    in Apple's retail stores. Initial in sales, I eventually moved to the Genius Bar as a 
                    technician. Pair that with Meta's "Connect 2021" event and unveiling of their plans 
                    surrounding A.R. and V.R. technology. I.T. sprung to the forefront of my mind. A.R. 
                    especially has very encouraging commercial and well as industry-based applications. 
                    In an environment where people were isolated from each other, the pandemic showed 
                    that working from home was not only possible but, in some areas, beneficial. All ideas 
                    have rocky territory to navigate, but the concept of the "Metaverse", a digital 
                    environment utilising and implementing various forms of technology to aid in the 
                    crucial, social and collaborative "work-from-home" dilemma, is a promising step in 
                    the right direction. Companies like Meta aren't the only ones pioneering 
                    ground-breaking concepts and technology. I don't know where I will fit into it, but 
                    I'm excited to see where this will take me.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>Outline your I.T. experience (if any)</h3>
                <p>
                    While remarkably limited, I have experience in backend systems from a production 
                    standpoint. I've worked as an audio tech/engineer, a broadcast technician, a camera 
                    operator and most recently, a Genius Bar technician (the equivalent of a mechanic to 
                    an engineer, really). I have experienced the basics of coding languages such as 
                    JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I took I.P.T. in high school as an elective in the 11th 
                    grade. All but useless, if I'm being honest. The class curriculum didn't have any 
                    particular depth to it, unfortunately. And they didn't pick it up as an elective going 
                    into the H.S.C. A mistake, in my opinion.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                <p>
                    With a rapidly changing, and dare I say, evolving means by which to learn and enter 
                    the workforce/job, RMIT's online study format, via Open Universities Australia, offers 
                    the flexibility and range I'm in the market for. Balancing working, studying, and a 
                    healthy home/social life is no mean feat. Upon doing research, and speaking with 
                    student support advisors, friends and colleagues who have undergone or are continuing 
                    to undergo online study, RMIT seemed the logical choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My larger degree, at this point in time, is the Bachelor of Information Technology; 
                    however, I do have a growing interest in coding and programming. I'm fascinated by the 
                    prospect of backend development and the skill it takes to build and maintain such 
                    large-scale systems.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                <p>
                    I expect to dive deeper into technology, its role and impact on the world and moving 
                    forward. I envision learning about innovation, how to approach the industry, 
                    developing valuable skills in preparation for entering the workforce, the different 
                    options available to me, and much more I'm yet to even think of. I expect to gain a 
                    better understanding upon which to build a foundation. To help me continue to learn, 
                    expand, and explore far beyond my studies.
