                <h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this 
                position appealing to you.</h3>
                <p>
                    The position requires you to execute and maintain a high quality of code and, by 
                    extension, security, integrity and performance surrounding specific applications. 
                    Utilising the likes of CI/CD, GitHub, and Jenkins as tools. Debugging and 
                    troubleshooting abilities are a requirement, and the need to meet deadlines is a 
                    vital aspect of the job. A desire to learn and excel is a must. And with that comes 
                    responsibility and personal pride in your work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most appealing part of this job, aside from an opportunity to work on projects 
                    used by the public day in and out, is the value placed on responsibility and integrity. 
                    Fostering a healthy environment that promotes transparent and fair collaboration can 
                    often sound like a pipe dream to some. But the level of innovation that Apple is 
                    working on and its relevant presence in today’s economy means that you're held 
                    accountable. Not only for any shortcomings that may arise but for all of the wins. 
                    The element of uncertainty, mixed with pressure, whilst striving to keep an 
                    equilibrium of sorts, means that you'd be challenged every day you step off the lift. 
                    What’s most reassuring is Apple’s commitment to equal opportunity. Regardless of race, 
                    religion, gender, or political standpoint. Everyone is guaranteed the same opportunity 
                    as those. And are treated as such. Makes for a very unique point of view when 
                    attacking issues head-on.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience 
                required for the position.</h3>
                <p>
                    Proven capacity in Java/Java E.E. and front and backend services ranging from XML, 
                    JSON, HTTP and SSL to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and all-encompassing J.S. frameworks. 
                    Additionally, experience and competencies in S.F.D.C. Apex, Visualforce, Lightning 
                    web components, relational databases, data modelling, object-oriented programming, 
                    and design patterns. Development environments like agile and scrum will also be in 
                    play.

                    My current capacity surrounding the requirements for this role is truthfully limited. 
                    I'm familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and have rudimentary knowledge and 
                    experience with XML, JSON, and HTTP. However, that is currently the extent of my 
                    ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                Other relevant information, although relative, includes my being an Apple Certified 
                Technician, having been through extensive training as an employee for Apple's base U.I. 
                and O.S., and gaining familiarity and the ability to perform repairs on their hardware. 
                I also have experience as a live audio engineer/technician, broadcast technician, 
                film set gaffer, camera operator, camera control unit, exposure operator, and 2nd 
                A.C., All of these, have contributed to skills surrounding critical assessment and 
                creative and logical problem-solving.

                <h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience 
                required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly 
                detailed (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as 
                specific as you can.</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting with this undergraduate degree in Information Technology, I plan to take my 
                    knowledge and investigate additional studies surrounding Cyber Security and general 
                    Computer Sciences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst studying, I have already begun to teach myself coding languages, starting with 
                    “back to basics” front-end languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. With plans to 
                    sequentially and strategically learn more due to my genuine interest surrounding the 
                    field. Reinforcing my foundations is a strategy I'm employing because I want to be 
                    confident in my ability. I believe that to demonstrate my impending expertise, I'll 
                    need to first be confident in my capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also plan to build a portfolio and develop projects close to my heart. The likes of 
                    which you'll be able to review in the "Project Ideas" section of this site.
