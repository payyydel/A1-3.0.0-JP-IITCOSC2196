                    <h3>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The position requires you to execute and maintain a high quality of code and by extension security, 
                        integrity and performance surrounding certain applications. Utilising the likes of CI/CD, GitHub and Jenkins 
                        as tools. Debugging and troubleshooting abilities are a requirement, and the need to meet deadlines is a key 
                        aspect of the job. A desire to learn and excel is a must. And with that comes responsibility and personal 
                        pride in your work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most appealing part of this job, aside from the opportunity to work on projects that are used by the 
                        public day in and out, is the value placed on responsibility and integrity. Fostering a healthy environment 
                        that promotes transparent and fair collaboration can often sound like a pipe dream to some. But the level 
                        of innovation that Apple is working on, coupled with this relevant presence in today’s economy means that 
                        you’re held accountable. For not only any shortcomings, and they do happen, we’re only human after all, 
                        but for all of the wins. The element of uncertainty, mixed with pressure, whilst striving to keep an 
                        equilibrium of sorts means that you’d be challenged every day you step off the lift. What’s most reassuring 
                        is Apple’s commitment to equal opportunity. Regardless of race, religion, gender or political standpoint. 
                        Everyone is guaranteed the same opportunity as those. And are treated as such. Makes for a very unique point 
                        of view when attacking issues head-on.
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Proven capacity in Java/Java EE and front and back-end services ranging from XML, JSON, HTTP and SSL, 
                        to JavaScript, HTML, CSS and all-encompassing JS frameworks. Additionally, experience and competencies in 
                        SFDC Apex, Visualforce, Lightning web components, relational databases, data modelling, object-oriented 
                        programming and design patterns. Development environments like agile and scrum will also be in play.
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <h3>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h3>
                    <p>
                        My current capacity surrounding the requirements for this role is truthfully limited. I have rudimentary 
                        experience with XML, JSON and HTTP. I’m familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, however, that is currently 
                        the extent of my ability.
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <h3>
                        A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building 
                        on those you have now.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Starting with this undergraduate degree in Information Technology, I plan to take my knowledge and investigate 
                        additional studies surrounding Cyber Security and general Computer Sciences. Whilst studying I have already begun to 
                        teach myself coding languages, starting with back to basics with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Reinforcing my foundations 
                        is a strategy I’m employing because I want to be confident in my ability. I believe, that in order to demonstrate my 
                        impending expertise, I’ll need to be confident in my capabilities first. I also plan to begin building a portfolio and 
                        developing projects that are close to my heart. The likes of which you’ll be able to review in the “Project Ideas” 
                        section of this site.
